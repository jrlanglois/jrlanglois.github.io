# Hello, world!

This is my engineering blog and notes site. I'll post architectural thoughts, design patterns, and lessons learned here.

- Trade-offs and decisions
- Media codecs
- Fun random software things that piqued my interest and whim

# About Me

Oh, hey! I’m a C++ software developer with over a decade of experience in the thrilling world of cross-platform apps and audio plugins. (Yes, thrilling - don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.)

I’m endlessly fascinated by new tools and tech - mostly because I like convincing myself that learning yet another library will somehow simplify my life. Spoiler: it rarely does. But nothing beats the joy of programming and creating clever, media-related solutions that (hopefully) don’t break the moment you look at them.

I’ve wrestled with more third-party APIs than I can count - from text and audio to video, analytics, and entire application frameworks. And true to form, if it’s open-source, you’ll probably find me poking around in the code, contributing patches, or just causing mild chaos (looking at you, JUCE community).

My platform playground has been eclectic: desktops (Windows, macOS, Linux), mobile (iOS, Android), smart TVs (WebOS, Tizen), game consoles (PS3, PS4, Xbox One), and embedded systems like set-top boxes. Nowadays, the toolchains are slightly less absurd - but don’t worry, I still enjoy the occasional joyride through proprietary cross-compiling hell.
