# Hello, world!

Welcome to my software engineering blog and notes corner. Here, I share architectural thoughts, design patterns, and lessons learned - basically the stuff I wish existed in the past that I could have had bookmarked for later.

Topics you will see:

* JUCE module design
* Cross-platform adventures (and misadventures)
* Trade-offs, tough decisions, and "why did I do that?" moments (sometimes fueled by one too many cups of coffee...)
* Media codecs and all their quirks
* Random software curiosities that caught my attention

# About Me

I'm Joël R. Langlois - a C++ developer obsessed with media apps, audio plugins, and clever solutions that actually work. I've played with desktops, mobile, smart TVs, game consoles, and embedded systems, and I've wrestled with more APIs than I care to admit.

Since I have broad experience, and 3 different diplomas to support that, you can call me a non-classic specialist. I’m drawn to systems where small structural differences create large behavioural outcomes. I tend to learn across domains, extract the underlying patterns, and reuse those models elsewhere. I care more about interfaces, constraints, and interactions than about domain-specific details.

Hopefully the things I write about here reflect that, and help view the world through my lense of interfaces, and mot objects.
