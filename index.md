# Hello, world!

This is my engineering blog and notes site. I'll post architectural thoughts, design patterns, and lessons learned here.

This might be related to:

- Module design
- Porting and cross-platform challenges
- Trade-offs and decisions
- Media codecs
- Fun random software things that piqued my interest and whim
