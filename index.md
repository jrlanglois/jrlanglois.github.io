# Hello, world!

Welcome to my software engineering blog and notes corner. Here, I share architectural thoughts, design patterns, and lessons learned - basically the stuff I wish existed in the past that I could have had bookmarked for later.

Topics you will see:

* JUCE module design
* Cross-platform adventures (and misadventures)
* Trade-offs, tough decisions, and "why did I do that?" moments (sometimes fueled by one too many cups of coffee...)
* Media codecs and all their quirks
* Random software curiosities that caught my attention

# About Me

I'm Joël R. Langlois - a C++ developer obsessed with media apps, audio plugins, and clever solutions that actually work. I've played with desktops, mobile, smart TVs, game consoles, and embedded systems, and I've wrestled with more APIs than I care to admit.

I'm always exploring new tools and libraries - mostly to convince myself they'll make life easier. Spoiler: they rarely do. But the thrill of programming? That never fades. And if it's open-source, there's a good chance that I'm poking around the code, contributing patches, or just causing mild chaos (looking at you, JUCE community).
