# Hello, world!

Welcome to my engineering blog and notes corner. Here, I share architectural thoughts, design patterns, and lessons learned—basically the stuff I wish I'd bookmarked for later.

Topics you might see:

* JUCE module design
* Cross-platform adventures (and misadventures)
* Trade-offs, tough decisions, and "why did I do that?" moments (sometimes fueled by one too many cups of coffee...)
* Media codecs and all their quirks
* Random software curiosities that caught my attention

# About Me

Hey there! I'm a C++ developer obsessed with media apps, plugins, and clever solutions that actually work. I've played with desktops, mobile, smart TVs, consoles, and embedded systems, and I've wrestled with more APIs than I care to admit.

I'm always exploring new tools and libraries - mostly to convince myself they'll make life easier. Spoiler: they rarely do. But the thrill of programming? That never fades. And if it's open-source, there's a good chance that I'm poking around the code, contributing patches, or just causing mild chaos (looking at you, JUCE community)."
